# Walkthrough of HL7/XDS demo from class
We used a tool, [7edit](http://www.7edit.com/home/index.php) to view an HL7 message and understand the different parts.

The message we used is in this repo, in teh SampleMessages folder [here](https://github.com/bhi-spring-591-2019/instructors/blob/master/SampleMessages/ADT_GREEN992.ADT).  It has a free trial period of 21 days.
In particular we looked at the PID segment which contains the patient identifier.
